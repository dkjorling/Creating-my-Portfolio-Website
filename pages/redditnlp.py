Entity-level sentiment analysis enables the extraction of more interesting insights, especially when combined with additional data such as player statistics. Key information sought from this analysis includes identifying the most and least-liked players during different periods of the year, understanding the close associations between players, and examining the alignment of players' sentiment with team and individual performance.",

These modifications were implemented to improve the accuracy and relevance of the sentiment analysis results. To comprehensively extract player mentions, co-reference resolving techniques were implemented. This process leveraged redditâ€™s hierarchical structure to identify all indirect mentions of a player by combining parent-child text and replacing pronouns with named entities. Additionally, sentence tokenization was implemented to isolate sentences specific to each entity for sentiment analysis, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the results. ",

This could potentially be attributed to his high-variance play style as a high-volume, somewhat inconsistent three-point shooter. Additionally, his status as a new player acquired midseason likely contributes to this notion. It is not surprising to see fan sentiment toward star player LeBron Jamesâ€™s being highly correlated with his on-court performance, but it is notable that the other team star, Anthony Davis, is more middle-of-the-pack in terms of sentiment correlation. On the other hand, players with negative correlation are mainly young players with future potential and generally high overall sentiment scores. The figure above highlights the stark differences between Malik Beasley and Troy Brown Jr. in terms of sentiment-net rating correlation.",

Sentiments towards the team's top players are amongst the most positively correlated with team winning percentage. Taken together, this indicates that sentiment towards star players is highly dependent on team performance, while sentiment towards role players is much more related to individual performance.
