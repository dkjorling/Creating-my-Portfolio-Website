Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you’ll find a diverse range of projects, from leveraging Deep Learning to generate financial alpha to linking fan sentiment with individual player performance. I recently developed a Web Scraping API that provides users easy data access and a comprehensive, automatically updated International Soccer database. I am currently working on a project that utilizes this database to develop a Transformer-based soccer betting model. Each project includes a detailed overview, links to the code on GitHub, and, in many cases, an interactive dashboard you can explore by clicking “Dashboard.”
