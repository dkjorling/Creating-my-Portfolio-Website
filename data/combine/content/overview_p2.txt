At the NFL Combine, prospective draft picks are measured in height, weight, and arm length and undergo various physical assessments, including the bench press and 40-yard dash. Specifically, the project focused on two key questions: 1) Can NFL Combine data be used to determine whether a player is drafted? and 2) For drafted players, can combine data predict draft pick position? To address these questions, I worked with another student to collect and clean the data and trained several predictive models. The models we used included: logistic regression, random forest classifiers, linear regression, Principal Component Regression (PCR), and XGBoost.
