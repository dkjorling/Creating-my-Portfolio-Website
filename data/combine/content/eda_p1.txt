These are two of my favorite visuals I created for this project. The box plot compares draft pick distributions for each position on the field. Defensive Ends and Tackles, who are often tasked with bringing down the opposing quarterback, have the lowest average draft pick selection. Another interesting insight is that Quarterbacks have a heavily skewed distribution which infers that top-end QBs are extremely valuable but on average the position is actually not drafted very high. The scatterplot matrix on the right shows the response variable plotted against four predictor variables. Surprisingly, none of the four variables have a noticeably strong relationship with draft pick. This was an early indication that combine stats are actually not great predictors for draft pick number.
