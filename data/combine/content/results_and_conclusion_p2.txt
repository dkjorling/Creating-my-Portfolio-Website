For the regression problem, I first built a linear model using the statsmodels library. Following a backward selection process, my final model predictors included weight, arm length, forty-yard dash, shuttle and position, and had an adjusted R-squared of 0.084. Although the low R-squared was expected, it was informative to see which variables were statistically significant. Subsequently, I used these same predictors to build a linear predictive model which resulted in a cross-validated RMSE of 67.0 picks.
