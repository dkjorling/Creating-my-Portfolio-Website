I chose to work on a project using NFL Combine data because I was genuinely curious about the impact of physical traits and measurements on NFL draft position. Being drafted or not drafted can be a multi-million dollar difference and often comes down to the finest of margins. The data set was also a great fit for applying a wide range of supervised modeling techniques, and I wanted to compare and contrast the results from each.
