I then implemented Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and used the first three principal components to train another predictive model, this time yielding a cross-validated RMSE of just 68.0 picks. Finally, I built a model using XGBoost which is a tree-based ensemble method that combines boosting and regularization. After tuning various hyper-parameters such as max tree depth and learning rate, the model produced a cross-validated RMSE of just 68.45. Comparing model results to the null model standard deviation of 69.8 suggests that combine statistics are not good predictors of draft position. Despite poor predictive power, the study still revealed the most important predictors, namely forty time and weight, and delivered the insight that combine results act more as a threshold for being drafted rather than a specific pick position.
