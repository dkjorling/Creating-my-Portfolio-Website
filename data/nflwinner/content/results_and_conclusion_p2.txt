Next, I fit a GAM using kernel regression which yielded an RMSE of .1609 compared to null standard deviation of .1919. The RMSE/SD ratio of the GAM was comparable to the OLS R-squared, and therefore the OLS model was selected as the final model due to its easier interpretability. Although the study did not uncover many insights related to optimal position allocation, it did reveal high total spend, low free agency spend and high number of trades as important factors in predicting win percentage. Additionally, the study suggests that linebackers are undervalued in the NFL draft. One potentially interesting extension of this study would be analyzing playoff performance instead of regular season performance.
