To achieve this goal, I sourced data primarily from Spotrac, which provided information related to salary cap allocation by position, and complete draft and transaction history. The study spanned 2013-2021 for all 32 teams and utilized a draft-pick value chart to assign the worth of each pick accurately. Additionally, I sourced average team age data to determine whether there is an optimal average roster age. In creating and analyzing this robust dataset, I aimed to uncover insights that can inform decision-making for NFL teams looking to build a winning team in the modern era.
