The bar plot displays salary cap and draft pick allocation for each on-field position. While most positions are allocated similarly between salary cap and draft resources, significantly more draft capital is used on Defensive linemen (DL) secondary (SEC) and running backs (RB) than salary space. Additionally, special teams players (ST) are nearly never drafted with valuable picks.
