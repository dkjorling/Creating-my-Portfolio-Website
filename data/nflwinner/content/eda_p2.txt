The scatterplots show the linear relationship between the response variable, regular-season win percentage, and two predictor variables: total spending and normalized free agency spending. While total spending has a strong positive relationship with winning percentage, free-agency spending is surprisingly negatively correlated with the response, indicating that it is often not beneficial to team performance.
