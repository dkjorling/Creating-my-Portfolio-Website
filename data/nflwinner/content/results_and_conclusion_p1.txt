I initially implemented OLS modeling which yielded a final model including total spend, free agency spend, trades made, average age, and linebacker draft proportion. The model resulted in an R-squared of 0.165, with nearly half of that number attributed to total spend. A disappointing finding was that there appeared to be no advantage in allocating salary cap or draft capital to certain positions, as only the linebacker draft proportion variable was statistically significant. This suggests that building a winning roster requires identifying and securing talent at all positions.
