This project has several challenges that I must overcome. Even though my database has a ton of data in it, only a fraction of the matches has advanced statistical data available. Additionally, there is plenty of missing data that will need to be dealt with. The next challenge will be whittling down 100 stats for both team and player into the most important statistics, by utilizing feature engineering. After all this I could still fail if I don't have enough data to sufficiently train my transformer which is an extremely data-hungry model. If I can get through the predictive modeling step, I am confident in transferring it to a betting model, but I have never explored such techniques before. As a former trader who used to partake in a fair amount of sports betting, building a betting model has always been a high priority project for me so I am very excited to work on this.
