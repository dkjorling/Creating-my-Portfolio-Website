I am currently developing a cutting-edge soccer betting transformer that leverages my extensive soccer database to create a transformer-based model for predicting match outcomes. This project involves constructing a predictive model that forecasts a team’s score by analyzing a range of data, including team and opponent details, match meta-data, and player statistics. The model will utilize data from the team's last five matches, the opponent’s last five matches, and the last five matches of the 11 starting players for both teams. Following the development of the predictive model, I will connect it to a betting model using Poisson distributions and explore wealth optimization strategies to refine and maximize the effectiveness of the betting approach.
