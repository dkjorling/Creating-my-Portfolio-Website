The fully-connected neural network consisted of a 21-node input layer, two hidden layers with 50 and 100 nodes respectively and an output layer yielding the final box office profit prediction. After splitting the data, I tuned various hyper-parameters on the training set before validating the model on the unseen test data. The final model was trained with the Adam optimizer, using a learning rate of 0.0001 and a batch size of 64 while running through 150 epochs.
