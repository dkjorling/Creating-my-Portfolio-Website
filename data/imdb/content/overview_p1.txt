The IMDb Analysis project is an excellent demonstration of my expertise in the complete data science pipeline, from data collection and cleaning to feature engineering, modeling, visualization, and front-end integration. My teammates and I scraped data using the IMDb API to build a comprehensive dataset of over 5,000 films, including data on genre, stars, awards, and plot summaries. Each team member was responsible for either conducting general EDA or modeling specific aspects of the data, while also creating a user-facing dashboard with real-world applications. In my case, I focused on training a fully-connected neural network to predict inflation-adjusted box office profit and integrating it into a user-friendly app.
