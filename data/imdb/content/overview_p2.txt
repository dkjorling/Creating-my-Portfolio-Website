As part of my responsibilities, I volunteered to clean the data and engineer features to create a robust final dataset for the whole team to use. My cleaning process involved removing films without budget or gross revenue data, extracting all awards won by parsing the 'awards' category, and converting any monetary variables to 2022 dollars for valid comparison across different time periods. To reduce model complexity and eliminate categories with few datapoints, I also condensed certain categorical variables such as ratings and genres. Additionally, I found that the release date of a film could be predictive of gross profit, so I created four 'time of year' categories as an additional predictor. Finally, I created numerical variables for star actors, actresses, directors, and writers, based on their frequency of appearances in the dataset called 'star power,' 'director popularity,' and 'writer popularity'. I inferred that these variables could serve as strong predictors of box office profits.
