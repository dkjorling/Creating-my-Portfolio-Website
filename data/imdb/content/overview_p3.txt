To build the neural network, I utilized the PyTorch framework, fine-tuning and optimizing the model until I achieved the best performance possible. I then integrated the trained model into a Plotly Dash application, creating a user-friendly interface that movie executives could use to estimate film profits based on various inputs. Our team also created an EDA dashboard, including sentiment analysis, and a movie generator dashboard that allows users to type in a phrase and receive a list of films that match the phrase. More details of the entire project are available in the attached PDF file.
