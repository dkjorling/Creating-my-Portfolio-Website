I built my portfolio website using Dash, a Python framework for building web applications. The website showcases my proficiency in data analysis, statistical modeling, and data visualization through a collection of projects I have completed. The website features a clean and intuitive design, with easy navigation to each project's page. On each project's page, visitors can view a brief description of the project, as well as data visualizations and dashboards created using Plotly.
