I also created a real-time implied volatility dashboard that pulls live options data from Yahoo Finance and displays a 3D surface visualization representing an assetâ€™s implied volatility surface. Two additional plots display implied volatility through strike space, given an expiration, and through expiration space, given a strike price. Eventually, I plan on creating additional analysis tools that pull data directly from my options database.
