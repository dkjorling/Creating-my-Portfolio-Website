My ultimate dream is to launch my own hedge fund using novel strategies. I understand how ambitious this is and the challenges in finding real alpha in the market, let alone raising money. However, I am passionate about exploring complex options-based strategies and furthering the work I started in my Master's thesis. My first step was to build an options database that automatically scrapes live real-time options price data multiple times a day.
