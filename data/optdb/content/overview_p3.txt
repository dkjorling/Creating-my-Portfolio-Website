To ensure the validity of inter-asset analysis, I prioritized upload speed by using thread pooling for concurrent API calls and pandas for bulk SQL inserts. This resulted in an optimized script that pulls and uploads approximately 300,000 rows of data in under one minute. In the future, the collected data will be used to test various inter-asset options strategies based on my Master's thesis research.
