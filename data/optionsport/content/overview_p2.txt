To account for the difficulty in collecting enough price data to train complex deep learning models, I used implied volatility data as a proxy for direct straddle prices. I trained various end-to-end deep learning models that directly maximize the Sharpe Ratio, a popular portfolio performance metric that is easily differentiable and therefore usable in back propagation. This approach contrasts with traditional two-step portfolio optimization methods that first estimate asset returns and covariances before solving a constrained optimization problem.
