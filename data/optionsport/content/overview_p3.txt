I implemented an expanding training window approach, using the first X years as a training set, the next year as a validation set, and the following year as a test set. I re-trained the model each year and tuned hyperparameters using the train and validation sets. Finally, the model was evaluated on the unseen test set, yielding the results shown below. Although costs were ignored for simplicity's sake, the Options Portfolio significantly outperformed all baselines and showed tremendous potential as a production trading strategy.
