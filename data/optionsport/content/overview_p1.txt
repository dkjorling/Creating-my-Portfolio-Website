My Master's Thesis combines my passion for deep learning architectures with my expertise in financial derivatives. While deep learning has been extensively researched for stock-based portfolios, there is a lack of literature on inter-asset options strategies. To fill this gap, I created a proof-of-concept Options Portfolio that takes daily long/short implied volatility positions in 315 underlying securities, leveraging the state-of-the-art Transformer Model as a foundation - the same model used in Chat GPT.
