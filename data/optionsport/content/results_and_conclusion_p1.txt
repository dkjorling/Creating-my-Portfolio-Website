The Options Portfolio outperforms the three baseline models (Equal-Weighted Long Portfolio, GRU, LSTM) in nearly every category. While the GRU and LSTM portfolios have slightly lower variance, this is more than offset by the substantially higher returns produced by the Options Portfolio. Impressively, the Options Portfolio has both the lowest average max-drawdown and the highest annual return, to yield a Calmar Ratio–the preferred metric for hedge-fund performance–more than double that of the GRU model, and 44 times higher than the equal-weighted portfolio.
