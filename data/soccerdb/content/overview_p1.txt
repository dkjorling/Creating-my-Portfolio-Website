I developed a comprehensive international soccer database designed to collect, clean, and manage data for over 70 leagues, 2,000 teams, and 100,000 players. This project involved creating a series of interconnected modules and processes to ensure data accuracy and completeness. At the heart of the project is a sophisticated web scraping and data cleaning system that manages various data types, including meta-data and match statistics for leagues, teams, and players.
