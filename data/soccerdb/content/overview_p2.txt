This was my most extensive Python project to date, encompassing three distinct sets of modules: one for scraping data for each class, one for cleaning and formatting the data, and one for uploading the data to a SQLite database. One of the project's greatest challenges was developing a workflow to integrate these components seamlessly. I created a Workflow class that automates the entire database update process while maintaining all data dependencies. Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to build scalable data management systems, automate complex workflows, and ensure data quality through rigorous testing and error management practices. This experience has set the stage for my next project: The Soccer Betting Transformer!
