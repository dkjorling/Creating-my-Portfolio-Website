The TensorFlow Embedding Projector is an incredibly cool visualization tool that transforms high-dimensional word vectorizations into a 3-D space. I published the embedding layer for red wines priced over $80. One of the first things you may notice is that the data is shaped almost like a bean, with a high density of words on either end. Since the NLP task used to train the embedding was based on sentiment, each end of the bean represents a pole, with one indicating negative sentiment and the other positive sentiment.
