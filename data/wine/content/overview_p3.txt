I wanted to explore the sentiment of wine drinkers to identify the varietals and properties of wine that drinkers prefer most based on both price point and type (red or white). Wine is complex and highly subjective, making this a unique and interesting project to tackle. I scraped 10 million wine reviews from the leading website Vivino, segmented the data into six categories based on price point and type, and trained a Transformer model with a 256-dimension embedding layer for each subset.
