I conducted a thorough descriptive term and varietal analysis of the results and wrote a detailed paper on the subject, available in the PDF link above. More excitingly, I published my embedded vectors to the TensorFlow Embedding Projector, which automatically applies PCA to reduce the embedding layers from 256 dimensions to 3 dimensions, allowing for visualization. Use the link above to access my Embedding Projector! The section below provides an overview of its features and instructions on how to use it.
