Additionally, I used the same Vivino data to develop a review generator capable of producing diverse types of reviews in the distinctive style of Vivino users. To achieve this, I implemented transfer learning, fine-tuning the highly complex pre-trained OpenAI GPT-2 model to generate reviews that are indistinguishable from actual user reviews. The main purpose of this was to learn about transfer learning, which I intend to extend to future projects. A brief analysis of the results is included below.
