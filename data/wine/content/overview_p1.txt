The two primary motivations behind this project are my passion for wine and my interest in deep learning embedding layers. I love that every wine has a story behind it and that such small differences in terroir or technique can distinguish an excellent wine from an average one. I enjoy reading about different wines and, of course, tasting them, and even plan to study for the entry-level sommelier exam in the near future.
