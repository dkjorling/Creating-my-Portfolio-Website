To account for the distinct characteristics of red and white wines, I added indicator text to specify whether a review was for a red or white wine. The generated reviews provide detailed descriptions of hypothetical wines, covering various flavors, color, acidity, alcohol content, and finish, and the writing style closely resembles actual wine reviews, often using short, incomplete sentences. Many reviews clearly indicate whether they refer to a red or white wine, and it is easy to distinguish between positive and negative reviews. While many generated reviews are indistinguishable from real ones, some show clear signs of being artificially created. A recurring issue is the repetition of words. For instance, the first "poor" positive and negative examples feature repeated use of "chocolate" and "earth/earthy," respectively. Another "poor" positive review mentions Chianti, Napa, and Bordeaux together, which doesn't make sense due to their distinct wine regions, revealing the model's limited knowledge.
