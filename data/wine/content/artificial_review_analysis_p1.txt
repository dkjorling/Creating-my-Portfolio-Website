Vivino wine reviews offer a unique set of textual data in terms of vocabulary and style, and I was curious to see if a powerful Transformer model like GPT-2 could generate artificial reviews indistinguishable from real ones. Initially, I attempted to build a review generator from scratch using a simple Transformer, but it wasn't powerful enough to consistently generate coherent reviews. Fine-tuning the GPT-2 model, however, yielded pleasantly surprising results and provided a valuable learning experience in implementing transfer learning.
