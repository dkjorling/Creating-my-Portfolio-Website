When Covid hit, I felt a strong urge to return home to Southern California, close to my family and the beach, and to explore new career paths. While I loved trading, my goal was to settle in Southern California, where trading opportunities are scarce. I was also drawn to the field of machine learning, which led me to UCLA, where I earned a Masterâ€™s in Applied Statistics with a perfect 4.00 GPA. My thesis, "Building an Options Portfolio," combines deep learning with my trading experience and is something I am extremely proud of.
