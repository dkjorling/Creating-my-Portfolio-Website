Currently, I work remotely as a Principal Quantitative Risk Analyst for Portland General Electric. I play a key role in developing new risk metrics and methodologies to support a rapidly changing portfolio, helping PGE meet Oregon regulations by reducing 2022 baseline emissions by at least 90% by 2030. This transition involves shifting from coal and natural gas to solar, hydro, and wind power, which are more affected by weather variability.
