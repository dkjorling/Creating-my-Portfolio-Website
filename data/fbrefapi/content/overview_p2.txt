To ensure scalability and reliability, I deployed the API using AWS Lambda. This serverless architecture minimizes costs and provides seamless scalability to handle varying loads. Additionally, I implemented an authentication system that issues API keys to users and stores them in an AWS DynamoDB database. This system ensures secure access to the API and allows for efficient management of user permissions and usage tracking.
