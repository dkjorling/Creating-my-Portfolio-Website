When I first heard about Natural Language Processing (NLP) near the beginning of my grad school tenure at UCLA, I became heavily interested in the subject. When I had the opportunity to finish my UCLA career with an NLP-intensive course, I jumped at the chance. This project was my final grad school project and I went all-out. It wasn't enough for me to do a simple sentiment analysis of easily-processed text. No. I had to  tackle the much more challenging task of entity-level sentiment analysis, where individual entities are identified throughout a text-based dataset and sentiment towards each individual entity is analyzed.
