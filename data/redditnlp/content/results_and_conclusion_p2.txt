One of the coolest parts of this project was getting to link player sentiment with performance. The two above plots show correlations between player sentiment and Net Rating (left) and player sentiment and team win percentage (right). The team's star players' (Lebron, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook) sentiments are much more closely related to the team win percentage rather than individual performance. For role players, that trend is the opposite.
