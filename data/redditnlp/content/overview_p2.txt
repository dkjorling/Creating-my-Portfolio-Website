I collected hundreds of thousands of comments from r/Lakers, a reddit forum dedicated to the Los Angeles Lakers, and analyzed fan sentiment toward each Laker player throughout the entirety of the 2022-23 NBA season. Since the official reddit API only gave access to 1,000 posts per subreddit, I used a custom web-scraping method to access every post and comment made throughout the season.
