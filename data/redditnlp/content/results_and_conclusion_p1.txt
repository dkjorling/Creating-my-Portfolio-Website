I calculated the above sentiment scores by subtracting the proportion of negative posts and comments from the proportion of positive posts and comments for each individual player. Given the team's strong late-season performance, it is unsurprising that the two highest sentiment scores belong to players who were acquired mid-season. While star players Lebron James and Anthony Davis accounted for approximately 40% of total player mentions, they had two of the lowest sentiment scores on the entire team. This is likely attributed to the team's overall poor performance compared to expectations.
