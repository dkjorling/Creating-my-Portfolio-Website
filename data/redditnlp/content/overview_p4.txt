I used the Vader Sentiment library for Sentiment Analysis and added customized sentiment lexicon including nickname adjustments (positive-sentiment nicknames/negative-sentiment nicknames), emoji-lexicon adjustments, basketball-specific lexicon adjustments and part of speech resolving. Finally, I implemented sentence tokenization to isolate sentences specific to each entity, which greatly enhanced my results. Keep reading below for more information relating to the project results. I HIGHLY recommend checking out my dashboard as well. It is definitely the most informative, aesthetic, and comprehensive dashboard I have built to-date.
