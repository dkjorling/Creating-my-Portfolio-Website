This last plot is a heatmap representing relative player associations and is definitely my favorite of this entire project. It highlights which players are most frequently referenced with each other relatively to how often they are referenced in general. The plot reveals groupings amongst star players, role players, and players involved in the same trade. Austin Reaves is an interesting case because, although he is seen as in-between a role player and star player, he is mentioned far more often with role players. Given he has one of the highest sentiment scores on the team, his low correlations with the star players and their relatively low sentiment scores makes sense. I think these types of plots are super interesting and would love to apply it to different use-cases. For more detailed analysis and visualization, check out the Dashbaord and PDF links above!
